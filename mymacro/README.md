writing a macro exercise [link](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust/exercises/macros)

in order to see the macro its great to use the [cargo-expand crate](https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-expand)
also, there is both a library and a binary in this crate. so its possible to run, `cargo test` and also `cargo run`.
